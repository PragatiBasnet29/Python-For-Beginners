# Note: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.
# Note: This page shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library, like the NumPy library.


fruits = ["Orange", "Banana", "Cherry", "Mango"]
print(fruits)
print(fruits[2]) # Get the value of the 3rd array item

fruits[0] = "Blue  Berry" # Modify the value of the first array item
print(fruits)

x = len(fruits) # Return the number of elements in the cars array
print(x)
